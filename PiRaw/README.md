piRaw
=====
Tool for RaspberryPi written in Python3 for capturing raw long exposure shots. Tested with:
- RaspberryPi 3
- Raspbian Jessie as of summer 2016
- PiNoir v2 camera

Its likely running with more recent versions as well, I just did not test it (yet).

A video of the Milkyway that I took in summer 2016 can be seen on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZNek8Q8Nys

Enjoy!
